1.        I used the command man man to access the manual pages and used the search feature “/” to look for the word “keyword” and I found the -k option. 
man -k keyword


2.        Using the commands “which cp” and “which wc”, the path to the programs were displayed.  
cp: /usr/bin/cp
         wc: /usr/bin/wc


3.        [ : No information found on man page. Running the whatis returns “nothing appropriate” 
w : Found on the manual page. Shows who is logged on and what they are doing.
X : Not a manual entry. However, using ls -l, I discovered that it is not an executable program but a symbolic link that points to X.org. 


4.        We use the command “ls -l /usr/bin/emacs”. The executable emacs appears to be a symbolic link that points to etc/alternatives/emacs. Thus, this is the file that was executed. 


5.        g+s : A file set to this when executed will have the permissions of the group that owns this file.
o-x : Remove permission for other to execute/access a certain file/directory. Both definitions were explain by the TA during the lab session. 


6.         -ctime -21
This answer was found by going through the man page of the find command and searching for the keyword “time”.Since 3 weeks is 21 days and ctime takes in an argument n that signifies the number of days we last modified the files, we pass in the argument “21”. 


7.        There are too many directories to list down here. 
From the lab discussions, we can add a “-type” option to find to list down only directories. Hence, we achieve this by using the command, “find / -ctime -21 -type d”


8.         By running the command “find -type l -ls | wc -l” after navigating to /bin. The wc commands counts the number of lines produced by find; thus, giving us the total number of links which is 247, since each line contains one link. 


9.        The files in the directory are listed from newest to oldest using the command “ls /usr/bin -l -t “
libfreeblpriv3.so 


10.         From the man pages of locale, locale gets its data from the settings of the local environment variables. The files for locale are located below:  
Archive: /usr/lib/locale/locale-archive
Definition files: /usr/share/i18n/locales


11.         
buffer-menu-sort
        sort-columns
        sort-fields
        sort-lines
        sort-numeric -fields
        sort-pages
        sort-paragraphs
        sort-regexp-fields
        tabulated-list-col-sort
        tabulated-list-sort
        
These commands were found by executing emacs, running the command C-h a and then C-s “search”. All the commands with the keyword “sort” were returned. 
        


12.        
C-M-a: beginning-of-defunc. Moves backwards to the beginning of a defunc
C-M-b: backward-sexp. Move backward across one balanced expression
C-M-c: exit-recursive-edit. Exit from the innermost recursive edit or minibuffer
C-M-d:        down-list. Move forward down one level of parentheses
C-M-e: end-of-defunc. Move forward to next end of defunc
C-M-f: forward-sexp.  Move forward across one balanced expression 
C-M-g: No keystrokes info found
C-M-h: mark-defunc. Put mark at end of this defunc, point at beginning. The defunc marked is the one that contains point or follows point. 


The keystrokes definition were found by executing emacs, running the command C-h b and C-x 0 to make the new window active and then C-s to look for “C-M-a”. Since the keystrokes were arranged in alphabetical order, the rest of the keystrokes were found.  


13.   C-g is called a "keyboard-quit" and signals a 'quit' condition. During an execution of a Lisp command, the process is terminated. When tested in emacs, C-g also cancels partially typed commands. 


14.   Yank inserts the most recent kill, leaving the cursor at the end of the inserted text. Yanking means bringing text from the kill ring back into the buffer. In practical terms, yank behaves like the paste function that we are all familiar with. 
The definition is found by accessing the emacs manual by typing C-h r and C-s “yank”. 


15.   Dired lists hidden files which in the directory /usr/bin represent the . and the .. directory but ls -l  does not. Dired can be invoked by using the command “C-x-d” and typing in the relevant directory.
