The first session of role playing involves me as the server
and my partner as the client. 
Some difficulties were encountered when I was trying to install
openssh-server. The openssh-client installed on the OS was
outdated but I wasn't able to update it. 
Since openssh-server has a dependency on openssh-client,
there was an installation error. 

Fortunately after tweaking around with the settings in
Software & Updates, I manage to solve the problem. 
Next I generate a public/private rsa key pair by using the
following command:
ssh -keygen

Create an account for client on the server
command:
sudo useradd -d /home/dir -m jayden
sudo passwd jayden

Create .ssh directory for new user
command:
cd /home/dir
sudo mkdir .ssh

Change ownership and permission on .ssh directory
command:
sudo chown -R username .ssh
sudo chmod 700 .ssh


Output:
Your identification has been saved in /home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:

The key's randomart image is:

Results:
My partner was able to successfully log in to my server. However, he 
was not able to use the ssh utility with the -X GUI option. It was mainly
due to an old version of X11 session forwarding. 

After searching online for a solution:
The fix was simply: 
"sudo apt-get install xorg openbox" to install/update xorg	              


The next session of role play involves me as the client and my
partner as the server/host. 

As the client I first generate public and private key pair
command:
ssh-keygen

Output:
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa): 
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again:

After knowing the username to my account set up on the host.
I copy my public key to the server for key-based authentication
command:
ssh-copy-id -i jun@10.97.85.169

Then I add private key to authentication (ssh-agent) to
make authentication more convenient. 
ssh -add

Output:
Enter passphrase for /home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa: 
Identity added: /home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa (/home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa)
ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ Generating public/private rsa key pair.

We then add SSH to server
ssh jun@10.97.85.169
Testing:
command:
ls
output:
examples.desktop
command: 
mkdir test
ls
output:
examples.desktop test

After verifying the creation of the directory of my partner's computer
I proceed to try out the -X option for ssh
command:
ssh -X jun@10.97.85.169
output:
