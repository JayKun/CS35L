Q1.
If we examine /src/ls.c, we see that case_long_iso_time_style:
is actually a label that the program
can jump to when needed. Notice that there are two such labels.
Brady merely removes one of the labels
to clean up code. The following lines of code would
still be executed with or without removing the extra label. 

Q2.
The patch removes the assignment of the users locale into the date format,
hence, it might cause
problems to countries that have their own comvention 
when it comes to date formats as their locale have
no effect on the date format. 

Q3.
The randline.py program outputs the following: 
"
File "randline.py", line 47, in <module>
    main()
File "randline.py", line 41, in main
    sys.stdout.write(generator.chooseline())
File "randline.py", line 11, in chooseline
    return random.choice(self.lines)
File "/usr/lib64/python2.6/random.py", line 261, in choice
    return seq[int(self.random() * len(seq))] 
	# raises IndexError if seq is empty
IndexError: list index out of range
"
Note that the error was raised in the file random.py instead of randline.py.
Since the random function needs to return a sequence of random numbers.
The sequence would be empty and thus, is an undefined behavior. 

Q4
File "randline.py", line 42
    except IOError as (errno, strerror):
                      ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

In Python3, errors are not passed as tuples,
instead there are passs as a single "er" object. 
If we intend to access errno and strerror,
we would need to do er.errorno and er.stderror
respectively.
